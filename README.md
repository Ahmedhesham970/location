# location
🌍 Project Description
In this project, I utilized several key technologies and libraries to create a robust location-based application:

🗺️ Google Maps Library: Integrated Google Maps to enable users to search for specific types of places, such as 🏫 schools, 🏋️ gyms, or any other point of interest. The application also supports searching for particular locations by name or coordinates 📍.

🌐 Geospatial Queries: Leveraged MongoDB's geospatial queries to efficiently handle location data and perform complex spatial operations 🚀.

📍 $geoNear Aggregation: Implemented the $geoNear aggregation pipeline stage to find and list locations in order of proximity to a given point, within a specified distance 📏. This feature is particularly useful for displaying the nearest places to the user 👤.

🔧 Other Features: The application includes additional functionalities, such as filtering results based on user preferences 🎯 and dynamically updating search results based on real-time location data 📡.
